        <h2>AI Art</h2>
        <div class="wrap">
            Not so long ago, Humans believed that there was one thing a computer could never do better than
            a human and that was to create art. No we have reached a stage in society where computer
            generated art is becoming a norm. <br>
            Some people believe that AI-generated images are the end of art as we know it, and that they
            <span class="doom"> spell doom </span>for the career of professional artists. <br>
            They believe that human made art will lose value and not be worth the time and effort when a computer
            can generate a work of art in a minute. <br>
            While AI may one day reach a stage of being able to produce art of higher quality than their
            human counterparts, I believe the current style of vague impressionist AI-generated art can
            be a great source of artistic inspiration for human artists, <br>
            whether they are painters or music producers or story writers.. AI art
            can spark the imagination and set the mood for a creative mind.
